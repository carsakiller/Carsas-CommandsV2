## About Carsa's Commands
[Carsa's Commands](https://c2.carsakiller.com/cc-website) is an addon for Stormworks that adds **over 50 commands** that implement everything from a better ban command to a command that teleports you to the nearest seat. To list a few, there is:

- `?equip` - Gives you specific equipment
- `?tpl` - Teleports you to named locations around the map
- `?charge` - Lets you set the charge of a battery on a vehicle
- `?heal` - Heals you or another player by a certain percentage\

## Install
Carsa's Commands v2 can be subscribed to on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780335340). Carsa's Companion can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Companion/releases).

## What's New?
[New to v2](https://c2.carsakiller.com/cc-website/#news) is a new [companion webapp](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Companion) that makes your life much easier by providing a nice graphical interface so you don't have to use the in-game chat to execute `?giveRole Admin Leopard` or `?equipp CrazyFluffyPony 21 4 20`.

There is a lot more that got added and improved, you can read more on [CÂ²'s website](https://c2.carsakiller.com/cc-website/)

## Contributors
Version 2 would have been abandoned a long time ago if it weren't for [CrazyFluffyPony](https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyFluffyPony/), [Dargino](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081415251), and [Leopard](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081580193). They all helped with fixing bugs and adding features but most importantly, helped encourage me to get to the finish line.

A very big thank you to them.

## Reporting Issues / Contributing
Since v2 has consisted of almost an entire rewrite of Carsa's Commands, there are bound to be some issues.

Please report all issues on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-CommandsV2/issues) page as it is a much better place to keep track of everything than the comments or discussions on Steam.

## Discussing
If you would like to discuss adding features, get help, or just float some ideas, there is the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-CommandsV2/discussions) page which is the preferred place for contact.

## There was a v1?
Version 1.03 can still be found on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2356110139) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Commands) however consider it to be archived as there will be no further action on those pages.

## The Future
I have not played Stormworks in over a year at this point, I have only launched the game to test Carsa's Commands. I do not intend to add much more to Carsa's Commands and the future will likely consist of just bug fixes.
