## About Carsa's Commands
[Carsa's Commands](https://c2.carsakiller.com/cc-website) is an addon for Stormworks that adds **over 50 commands** that implement everything from a better ban command to a command that teleports you to the nearest seat. To list a few, there is:

- `?equip` - Gives you specific equipment
- `?tpl` - Teleports you to named locations around the map
- `?charge` - Lets you set the charge of a battery on a vehicle
- `?heal` - Heals you or another player by a certain percentage\

## Install
Carsa's Commands v2 can be subscribed to on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780335340). Carsa's Companion can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Companion/releases).

## Dedicated Server Setup
> **Important Note:** The first player to join the server will be made an owner. To override this, please look at [Setting an Owner](#setting-an-owner)
1. Navigate to `%appdata%\Stormworks\data\missions\` and copy the whole `Carsa's Commands` folder
2. Assuming your dedicated server is installed here: `C:\Server\server64.exe`, paste the mission folder into `C:\Server\`
3. If your dedicated server has not been started before, make sure you start it at least once so it can generate some configuration files
4. Open `%appdata%\Stormworks\server_config.xml` in a text editor
5. Under the `<playlists>` tag, add the following:
```xml
<path path="Carsa's Commands"/>
```
### Setting an Owner
To override the automatic assigning of an owner when the very first unique player joins, you can do the following:
1. Open `script.lua` (can be found in the location from step 2 of [the setup](#dedicated-server-setup))
2. On line 13, you should find the following:
```lua
local OWNER_STEAM_ID = "0"
```
3. Please enter your steamID where the `0` is, leaving the quotes around it.
#### How to Find Your SteamID
Using the Steam desktop client:
1. Select `Steam` in the top right
2. Select `Settings`
3. Select `Interface`
4. Make sure that `Display web address bars when available` is checked.
5. Close the settings window and mouse over your username at the top
6. Select `Profile`
7. You should now see your steamID in the URL bar in between the final two slashes `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/<steamID>/`

**Note:** If you have set a custom URL, you will not see your steamID in the url but rather your custom URL. To find your steamID, do the following:
1. Copy URL from profile screen
2. Visit [Steam ID Lookup](https://steamid.io/lookup)
3. Paste the link in the search box and submit
4. Copy the `steamID64` value, this is your steamID

## What's New?
[New to v2](https://c2.carsakiller.com/cc-website/#news) is a new [companion webapp](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Companion) that makes your life much easier by providing a nice graphical interface so you don't have to use the in-game chat to execute `?giveRole Admin Leopard` or `?equipp CrazyFluffyPony 21 4 20`.

There is a lot more that got added and improved, you can read more on [CÂ²'s website](https://c2.carsakiller.com/cc-website/)

## Contributors
Version 2 would have been abandoned a long time ago if it weren't for [CrazyFluffyPony](https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyFluffyPony/), [Dargino](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081415251), and [Leopard](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081580193). They all helped with fixing bugs and adding features but most importantly, helped encourage me to get to the finish line.

A very big thank you to them.

## Reporting Issues / Contributing
Since v2 has consisted of almost an entire rewrite of Carsa's Commands, there are bound to be some issues.

Please report all issues on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-CommandsV2/issues) page as it is a much better place to keep track of everything than the comments or discussions on Steam.

## Discussing
If you would like to discuss adding features, get help, or just float some ideas, there is the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-CommandsV2/discussions) page which is the preferred place for contact.

## There was a v1?
Version 1.03 can still be found on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2356110139) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/carsakiller/Carsas-Commands) however consider it to be archived as there will be no further action on those pages.

## The Future
I have not played Stormworks in over a year at this point, I have only launched the game to test Carsa's Commands. I do not intend to add much more to Carsa's Commands and the future will likely consist of just bug fixes.
